1. First, install the Extension via Extension-Manager and agree to make updates.
2. After successful installing, press F5 to reload the backend, so you can see a new 
module in the Commerce section called "Coupons".
3. Create a page with title "coupons" for example, maybe also in the shop-section.
	"No-cache"-option must be enabled!
		This one get´s at least one content element of type "insert Plugin". 
		Choose the Plugin "Gutscheine einlösen."
4. Create 2 new subpages (of page "coupons"), make it "not in menu":
	- 1st page: will get the content elements for cashing vouchers, error messages, and so on...
		-- e.g.:
			* Cash your voucher
			* Coupon cashing not successful
			* coupon error msg
			* coupon ok msg
	- 2nd page: will be the page with content for a coupons support page.
5. Add "Include static (from extensions):" "COMMERCE coupons" to your Main Template
		best thing would be to copy the constants into your template and edit the values to your needs.
		
On page "coupons" you should now see the input form for a coupon code.

Create a coupon in backend module, use Category "enabled". As "Article" you have to choose from
commerce sysfolder "products", because coupons have been created as articles there. 
Choose "syscoupons_use".

To view the coupons in the basket or checkout, you have to 
put a marker ###COUPON_VIEW### in the template files commerce-pi2 and -pi3.

In pi2: add it after line "###BASKET_PRODUCT_LIST###"
